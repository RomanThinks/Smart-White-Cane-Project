All source material for the Smart White Cane Project

In the different branches will be the source code that had been developed for the three components of the Smart White Cane.

Smart Glasses: The Smart Glasses would have an integrated AI that would detect objects, take pictures, and send them to the Smart White Cane's central processing unit (Raspberry Pi) to interpret the image and return a resonse to the Smart Glasses. With an integrated speaker, a noise produced will alert the user that an object is close to them.

Mobile App: Using Android Studio, the Mobile Application is intended to pair via bluetooth to the Smart White Cane which in turn connects to the Smart Glasses. Through the Mobile Application, users can set directions to navigate to different places, cutomize the Smart White Cane's settings, and program commands for the Smart White Cane to operate with.

Smart White Cane: The Smart White Cane is an accessibility device for the visually impaired. It is as light and versatile as a regular White Cane and can be used the same way. Fitted with an ultra-sonic sensor, the Smart White Cane can sense objects close to its vicinity at an angle where conventional White Canes could not detect. Haptic feedback through motors would cause a vibration for the user to be aware of its upcoming surrounding.
